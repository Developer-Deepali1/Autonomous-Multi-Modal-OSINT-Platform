🚀 Autonomous Multi-Modal OSINT Platform
AI-Driven, Agentic, Cross-Modal Open-Source Intelligence System
“From digital traces to actionable intelligence — autonomously.”

🏆 Hackathon Pitch 
The Autonomous Multi-Modal OSINT Platform is an AI-powered, self-directed intelligence system that automatically collects, correlates, and visualizes text, image, video, social, and network-level open-source data to uncover hidden digital footprints of individuals, entities, or events.

Unlike traditional OSINT tools, this platform uses autonomous agents, reverse OSINT reasoning, and graph-based intelligence fusion to generate investigation-ready insights with minimal human input.

🎯 Problem Statement
Modern investigations suffer from:
Fragmented OSINT tools
Manual, time-consuming analysis
No cross-modal correlation
No intelligence graphing
No autonomous reasoning

Result: Missed connections, slow response, and low signal-to-noise ratio.

💡 Our Solution
An end-to-end autonomous OSINT ecosystem that:
Thinks like an investigator
Acts like an AI agent
Sees across multiple data modalities
Connects data into an intelligence graph
Produces actionable insights, not raw data

✨ Key Features 
🤖 Autonomous Intelligence Agent
Self-planning OSINT workflows
Dynamic tool selection
Goal-driven investigation logic
Auto-expands leads & hypotheses
🧠 Multi-Modal OSINT
Modality	Capability
📝 Text	Username, email, metadata, leaks
